Tasks for iOS
=============

Welcome to the most badly written to-do app ever! For this project we created a
very simple to-do app and filled it with as many bugs as possible. Your job is
to tidy up the code and make the app work properly. It’s an opportunity for you
to show off your coding skills in the best light possible. We had lots of fun
building (breaking) this project and we hope you have just as much fun fixing
it :)

Problems in the app range from small bugs and untidy code style to major
architectural issues. Feel free to totally rip the code apart or even write the
whole app again from scratch. If you work with the existing code, we recommend
you start with the Task class, then move on to the TaskCell and
TasksTableViewController.

Don’t worry about finding the perfect or ‘correct’ solution; there are many
different ways to fix this app. In fact, within Cultured Code we’ve already had
a few controversial discussions over different parts in the code.

This should be a fun exercise, so we want to avoid too much work on your part.
The following changes and improvements are not necessary as far as we’re
concerned:

- Adding new features to the app.
- Adding a proper model and data persistence layer.
- Adding or using XIB files. We only sparingly use them at Cultured Code anyway.
- Writing unit tests.
- Adding headerdoc style class documentation to header files.
- Setting up the project to use xcconfig configuration files.
- Setting up gcov or another test coverage calculation tools.
- Creating or editing graphics in photoshop.
- Adding a mechanism to edit the default task data. The app is obviously not
  suitable for real world use in this state, but that is not the goal.

Feel free to write in (developers@culturedcode.com) if you are unsure of
anything.

Otherwise, have fun!
